# Crowd Facial Emotion Detection

A real-time facial emotion recognition system that detects and classifies emotions in a crowd using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This project was developed as part of the Community-Focused Engineering Design (CFED) initiative.

## üìå Overview

This project leverages **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to analyze video feeds and identify the emotional state of individuals in a crowd. The goal is to provide emotion-based insights that can be used in scenarios like event management, public safety, and behavioral analysis.

## üß† Features

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
- Emotion classification into categories like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, **Neutral**, etc.
- CNN model trained on a facial expression dataset (e.g., FER-2013).
- Live video feed analysis with bounding boxes and emotion labels.
- Summary statistics on dominant emotions in the frame.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- Keras / TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Pre-trained CNN (or custom-trained model)

  
## üí° Use Cases

- Public event monitoring
- Classroom engagement analysis
- Storefront customer emotion analysis
- Surveillance systems for crowd behavior
